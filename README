This repository contains the Bash configuration that the author uses as a
"normal" user or as root. The "normal" user Bash configuration is in the
subdirectory "for_a_user", and the root Bash configuration is in the
subdirectory "for_root".

Each subdirectory contains a .bashrc file and one or more files with a name
starting with .bashrc_ that the .bashrc file sources automatically.

The repository also contains the file install_thierr26_bash_config which is a
shell script (actually a dash script) to copy the files to the user's home
directory or to the directory specified on the command line. Launch the script
with the --help option for a more detailed documentation. Note that no backup
of the overwritten files is done by the script.

Let's shed some light on some of the functions that could be of interest to
some users:

----------------------------------------------
* search() (defined in for_a_user/.bashrc_find):

If you often search in source trees with commands like:

find my_source_tree_root -name "*.c" -exec grep -H "my_function(" {} \;

you may appreciate the search() function that does the same with shorter
commands:

search "my_function(" "*.c" my_source_tree_root

Or (if your tree root is the current directory):

search "my_function(" "*.c"

----------------------------------------------
* ccal() (defined in for_a_user/.bashrc_cal_and_task):

The ccal() function produces an output similar to the command:

gcal .

but narrower (the previous month is removed).

The ccal() function needs the gcal program to be installed. On a Debian
system, gcal is available in the gcal package.

----------------------------------------------
* cda() (defined in for_a_user/.bashrc_cd)

The autofs users may find the cda() function useful. It has been written to
avoid having to type commands like:

cd /var/autofs/removable/my_removable_disk

to change directory to automountable removable file systems.

Before using cda(), and assuming that you have configured autofs, make sure
you have:
- generated an autofs map file using (as root) function autofsmap() defined in
  for_root/.bashrc_automount,
- made the generated file readable by the users that want to use cda(),
- set an environment variable called AUTOFSMAP to the path name of the
  generated file.

When called without argument, cda() interactively helps the user change
directory to an automountable removable file system. cda() prints a numbered
list of the removable file systems that are currently mountable. The user just
has to type in the number to change directory to the selected file system.

If you already know the number associated to the file system, use this number
as an argument to cda() to change directory to the file system directly.
