This repository contains the Bash configuration that the author uses as a
"normal" user or as root. The "normal" user Bash configuration is in the
subdirectory "for_a_user", and the root Bash configuration is in the
subdirectory "for_root".

Each subdirectory contains a .bashrc file and one or more files with a name
starting with .bashrc_ that the .bashrc file sources automatically.

The repository also contains the file install_thierr26_bash_config which is a
shell script (actually a dash script) to copy the file to the user's home
directory or to the directory specified on the command line. Launch the script
with the --help option for a more detailed documentation. Note that no backup
of the overwritten files is done by the script.
